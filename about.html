			Hello, I am Lordrockit, a 13 year old game developer, programmer, scripter, and 3d artist, and I am the developer of JS Paint, an open-sourced JavaScript/web based paint program.  JS Paint features many important elements of paint programs, draw and erase, but it has much more than that, it also has: dimension changing, RGB color picker, a gradient(also for picking colors), somewhat of an undo feature, changing brush sizes, a clear function, and of course a save function! That's a lot of stuff for 235 lines of messy code.  But like i said befor its all open <a href="source.html"><button>sourced!</button></a> So go paint with <a href="index.html"><button>JS Paint!</button></a>
